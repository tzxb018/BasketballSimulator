This physics basketball simulator utlizes kinematics to simulate a basketball shot.Two players can play this game. Players can take turn in each quarter to try to score as many points they can in 90 seconds (per quarter). Use the shoot button to shoot the ball. Use the sliders to change the angle, power, and even the gravity of the environemnt to try to shoot the ball into the hoop. The hoop will move after a shot is made or the player decides to move the basket with the change basket button. A player can cancel his/her shot mid-air if he/she realizes it will not go in with the stop button. The ball will respawn back at the starting position. Have fun!
